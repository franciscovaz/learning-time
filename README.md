## Clean Code  

**06/09/22 (pg. 75-92)**

* Code formatting is about communication, and communication is the professional developer's first order of business
* We would like a source file to be like a **newspapper article** - Newspapper Metaphor
* **Dependent Functions:** if one function calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the call, if at all possible. This gives the program a better flow.


**07/09/22 (pg. 93-101)**

* Data Transfer Objects (**DTO's**): A data structure is a class with public variables and no functions. This is a DTO.
* **Objects** expose behaviour and hide data... **Data structure** expose data and have no significant behaviour.

**08/09/22 (pg. 103-112)**

* Instead of experimenting and trying out the new stuff in our production code, we could write some tests to explore our understanding of the third-party code. - Learning tests.
* It's better to depend on something you control than on something you don't control, lest it end up controlling you.

**09/09/22**

* Review

**13/09/22 (pg. 121-135)**

* Test code is just as important as production code... It must be kept as clean as production code.
* Single concept per Test
* F.I.R.S.T : Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-Validating, Timely.
* Tests preserve and enhance the flexibility, maintainability, and reusability of the production code.


**14/09/22 (pg. 135-151)**

* There is seldom a good reason to have a public variable.
* Sometimes we need to make a variable or utility function protected so that it can be accessed by a test.
* The Single Responsability Principle (SRP) states that a class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change.
* SRP is one of the more important concept in OO design.


**15/09/22 (pg. 153-170)**

* 

**19/09/22 (pg. 171-176)**

* A design it's 'simple' if it follos these rulles:
  - Runs all the tests
  - Contains no duplication
  - Expresses the intent of the programmer
  - Minimizes the number of classes and methods
* Writting tests leads to better designs
* So take a little pride in your workmanship... Just take care of what you've created. Care is a precious resource.


**20/09/22 (pg. 177-191)**

* Concurrency can sometimes improve performance, but only when there is a lot of wait time that can be shared between multiple threads or multiple processors.
* A good way to avoid shared data is to avoid sharing the data in the first place. In some situations it is possible to copy objects and treat them as read-only.
* Attempt to partition data into independent subsets than can be operated on by independent threads, possibly in different processors.
* First and foremost, follow the Single Responsability Principle.


**23/09/22 (pg. 193-250)**

* Successive Refinement:
  - To write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it
  - Test-Driven Development. One of the central doctrines of this approach is to keep the system running at all times.
  - Refactoring is a lot like solving a Rubik's cube. There are a lots of little steps required to achieve a large goal. Each step enables the next.
  - This separation of concerns makes the code much simpler to understand and maintain.
  - So the solution is to continuously keep your code as clean and simples as it can be. Never let the rot get started.


**23/09/22 (pg. 251-265)**

* The Boy Scout Rule tell us we should leave it cleaner than we found it.
* Often one refactoring leads to another that leads to the undoing of the first. Refactoring is na iteractive process full of trial and error, inevitably converging on something that we feel is worthy of a professional.
* each os us has the responsability to leave the code a little better than we found it

## How to win friends and influence people  

**08/10/22 (pg. 0-xxviii)**

* In such technical lines as engineering, about 15% of one's financial success is due to one's technical knowledge and about 85% is due to skill in human engineeting - to personality and the ability to lead people.

* The person who has technical knowledge plus the ability to express idead, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people - that person is headed for higher earning power.

* That survey revealed that health is the prime interest of adults - and that their second interest is people

* We learn by doing.

**10/10/22 (pg. 3-21)**

* An animal rewarded for good behaviour will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behaviour. Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans. By criticing, we do not make lasting changes and often incurresentment.

* Lets realize that criticisms are like homing pigeons. They allways return home. Lets realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return; or, like the gentle Taft, will say: ' I don’t see how I could have done any differently from what I have.'

* Instead of condemning people, lets try to understand them….

**11/10/22 (pg. 22-33)**

* We often take our spouses so much for granted that we never let them know we appreciate them.

* The next time you enjoy filet mignon at the club, send word to the chef that it was excellently prepared, and when a tired salesperson shows you unusual courtesy, please mention it.

* Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be 'hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise', and people will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime - repeat them years after you have forgotten them.


**13/10/22 (pg. 34-54)**

* So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.

* Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself: 'How can I make this person want to do it?'

* Mind you, I got this reduction without saying a word about what I wanted. I talked all the time about what the other person wanted and how he could get it.

* … customers like to feel that they are buying - not being sold.

* First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.


**21/10/22 (pg. 55-70)**

* You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

* If we want to make friends, let's put ourselfs out to do things for other people - things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness.

* We are interested in others when they are interested in us.

* If you want others to like you, if you want to develop real friendships, if you want to help others at the same time as you help yourself, keep this principle in mind: 
  - Become genuinely interested in other people.


**26/10/22 (pg. 71-89)**

* Actions speak louder than words, and a smile says, 'I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you.' That is why dogs make such a hit. They are so glad to see us that they almost jump out of their skins. So, naturally, we are glad to see them. A baby's smile has the same effect.

* 'People who smile,' he said, 'tend to manage, teach and sell more effectivelly, and to raise happier children. ... That's why encouragement is a much more effective teaching device than punishment.'

* people rarely succeed at anything unless they have fun doing it.

* ... Chinese... had a proverb... 'A man without a smiling face must not open a shop.'

* PRINCIPLE 2 - Smile.
