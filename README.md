* Code formatting is about communication, and communication is the professional developer's first order of business
* We would like a source file to be like a **newspapper article** - Newspapper Metaphor
* **Dependent Functions:** if one function calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the call, if at all possible. This gives the program a better flow.
