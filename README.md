* Code formatting is about communication, and communication is the professional developer's first order of business
* We would like a source file to be like a **newspapper article** - Newspapper Metaphor
* **Dependent Functions:** if one function calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the call, if at all possible. This gives the program a better flow.

* Data Transfer Objects (**DTO's**): A data structure is a class with public variables and no functions. This is a DTO.
* **Objects** expose behaviour and hide data... **Data structure** expose data and have no significant behaviour.

* Instead of experimenting and trying out the new stuff in our production code, we could write some tests to explore our understanding of the third-party code. - Learning tests.
* It's better to depend on something you control than on something you don't control, lest it end up controlling you.
